* Vibrato effect
* Simplified zeroing of channel state during song start
* Pattern effects use RTS dispatch
* Corrected namespacing of some APIs
* Standardized names of feature defines (PENTLY_USE_*) and
  moved them to pentlyconfig.inc
* Feature defines to disable vibrato and arpeggio effects, counting
  rows per beat, attack track, and the attack envelope entirely
* Split manual into separate documents for concept overview and
  bytecode description because with pentlyas and ft2pently, few
  need to deal directly with bytecode
* Applied MIT License (Expat variant) throughout

0.05wip4 (2016-06)
* Project moved to GitHub: https://github.com/Qix-/pently
* pentlyas.py: proper argument parsing
* pentlyas.py: options to read input from stdin, write output to file
* pentlyas.py: option to generate period table (requested by dougeff)
* pentlyas.py: writes data sizes in bytes as comments in output
  (requested by NovaSquirrel)
* pentlyas.py: turned some internal exceptions into informative
  error messages (reported by NovaSquirrel)
* pentlyas.py: treats r and w the same in drum patterns
  (requested by NovaSquirrel)
* pentlyas.py: parentheses for slur for LilyPond parity
* Legato note overwrites uninjected attack's pitch
  (reported by NovaSquirrel)

0.05wip3 (2016-01)
* Corrected namespacing of pently_stop_music and pently_resume_music
  (reported by JRoatch)
* Allows relocating temporary zero page space (requested by JRoatch)
* pentlyas.py: Refactored without "god object"
* pentlyas.py: Changed syntax for arpeggio effect; the original
  was based on a misreading of MCK Beginner's Guide
* pentlyas.py: Optimizes out data of combined envelopes (instrument
  attacks and sound effects) that are a subsequence of a longer one.
  This improves handling of the "latebanjo" and "bf98flute2"
  instruments in the example songs.

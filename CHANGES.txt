0.05wip8 (future)

* Compress 0-pitch frames of instrument envelopes
* pentlyas.py: correctly parse drum names starting with "l"

* pentlyas.py: special filename - means standard output
* pentlyas.py: output lists each song's total size in comments
* Add "Isometry" song demonstrating attack track more thoroughly
* makefile: change score filename
* NES/NSF executables no longer in Git; will be in releases instead

0.05wip7 (2017-09)
* Change to zlib license, which preserves the spirit of the
  original license but is recognizable by GitHub
* Add portamento, the single most requested feature
* paldetect: Interleave with vwait so as not to depend on NMI handler
* pentlyas.py: Add 8 predefined chord names
  (M, maj7, dom7, aug, m, m7, dim, dim7)
* pentlyas.py: Score can define new chord names
* pentlyas.py: Add single-note arpeggio syntax similar to LilyPond
  chord mode (thanks to retrodpc for testing)
* pentlyas.py: Option to name chord by its top note instead of bottom
* pentlyas.py: First and second inversions of chords
* Arpeggio can be set to slow or fast (requested by w7n)

0.05wip6 (2017-06)
* Patterns can change channel volume in 25% steps
* Rest in attack track no longer corrupts pulse 1 arpeggio
* pentlyconfig.inc: Change engine's code and data segment; disable
  pulse channel effect pooling and volume comparison; change
  initial $4011 value
* Optionally enable sound effects in NSF
* pentlyas.py: Faulty play command produces better diagnostics.
  Shows song name; emits one for playing pattern too low.
* pentlyas.py: Command line option to change output segment
* pentlyas.py: Clamp vibrato depth to in-range values
* pentlyas.py: Ignore loops in volume envelopes pasted from
  FamiTracker
* NSF header gets load address from linker configuration
* Document use of equal temperament

0.05wip5 (2016-06)
* Vibrato effect
* Simplified zeroing of channel state during song start
* Pattern effects use RTS dispatch
* Corrected namespacing of some APIs
* Standardized names of feature defines (PENTLY_USE_*) and
  moved them to pentlyconfig.inc
* Feature defines to disable vibrato and arpeggio effects, counting
  rows per beat, attack track, and the attack envelope entirely
* Split manual into separate documents for concept overview and
  bytecode description because with pentlyas and ft2pently, few
  need to deal directly with bytecode
* Applied MIT License (Expat variant) throughout

0.05wip4 (2016-06)
* Project moved to GitHub: https://github.com/Qix-/pently
* pentlyas.py: proper argument parsing
* pentlyas.py: options to read input from stdin, write output to file
* pentlyas.py: option to generate period table (requested by dougeff)
* pentlyas.py: writes data sizes in bytes as comments in output
  (requested by NovaSquirrel)
* pentlyas.py: turned some internal exceptions into informative
  error messages (reported by NovaSquirrel)
* pentlyas.py: treats r and w the same in drum patterns
  (requested by NovaSquirrel)
* pentlyas.py: parentheses for slur for LilyPond parity
* Legato note overwrites uninjected attack's pitch
  (reported by NovaSquirrel)

0.05wip3 (2016-01)
* Corrected namespacing of pently_stop_music and pently_resume_music
  (reported by JRoatch)
* Allows relocating temporary zero page space (requested by JRoatch)
* pentlyas.py: Refactored without "god object"
* pentlyas.py: Changed syntax for arpeggio effect; the original
  was based on a misreading of MCK Beginner's Guide
* pentlyas.py: Optimizes out data of combined envelopes (instrument
  attacks and sound effects) that are a subsequence of a longer one.
  This improves handling of the "latebanjo" and "bf98flute2"
  instruments in the example songs.
